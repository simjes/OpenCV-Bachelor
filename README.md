OpenCV-Bachelor
===============
SimCV is an application using the open source library OpenCV where CV is short for Computer Vision.  
It showcases the different possibilities you have with this library and uses the camera on your device to detect faces, circles, foreground and track colors. SimCVGame shows how we can use OpenCV in a game.  

SimCV is a product of a Bachelor Thesis from University of Stavanger written by Simon Jespersen and Simen Sollie.
